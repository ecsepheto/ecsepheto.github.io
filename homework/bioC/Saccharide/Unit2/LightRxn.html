    <h1>Light Reaction</h1>
    <h2>Light Dependent Reaction</h2>
    <li>Step1
    <ul>Photon strikes PSII and excites an electron</ul>
    <ul>The excited electron left PSII and go to electron carrier (Redox Reaction, PSII oxidized)</ul>
    <ul>H2O splited by Water-Spliting Enzyme, sends one electron</ul>
    <ul>Oxygen and Hydrogen ion is then produced. Oxygen goes outside of the cell as a by-product, and the Hydrogen ion remains in Thylakoid space</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Step2
    <ul>Electrons from PSII is transfered through a series of REDOX reactions (ElectronTransportSystem)</ul>
    <ul>As pass through those proteins, Energy is released to pump Hydrogen ions into the Thylakoid space</ul>
    <ul>This finally creates a Ion-Gradient. The concentration of Hydrogen ions is higher inside and can be used for chemiosmosis</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Step3
    <ul>PhotoSystemI captures light Energy and excites electron</ul>
    <ul>The excited electron leaves PhotoSystemI and then replenished by the electron from PhotoSystem II</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Step4
    <ul>NADP Reductase needs to be oxidized</ul>
    <ul>So NADP+, the final electron acceptor, pulls electron out of the chain and produces NADPH</ul>
    </li>

    <h3>Chemiosmosis & ATP</h3>
    <li>ATP Synthase pumps H+ out of the membrane to make ATP</li>
    <li>The left H+ ion is then combined with NADP+ to form NADPH in the stroma. </li>

   <h3>Electron Transport Cyclic Flow:</h3>
    <li>Occurs at PhotoSystem I</li>
    <li>The electron carrier didn't take the excited electron to NADP reductase, but take it back to b6-f complex.</li>
    <li>So no NADPH is made at this round because the electron is not delivered to NADP reductase. However this won't affect ATP syntheize and one more ATP is made. </li>
    <li>Because a ratio of 3ATP:2NADPH is needed for Calvin Cycle to continue, so one more ATP must be made. </li>
