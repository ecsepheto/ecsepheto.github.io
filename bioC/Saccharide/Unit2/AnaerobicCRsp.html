    <h1>Fermentation</h1>
    <h2>Chemical process by which molecules such as glucose are broken down anaerobically. </h2>
    <div>Can't enter Kreb's Cycle in anaerobic condition because the lack of oxygen makes pyruvate can't be oxidized. </div>
    
    <h3>Lactic Acid Fermentation</h3>
    <div>Carried out by some single celled organisms and animal muscle cells.</div>
    <div>Pyruvate is reduced into a 3-Carbon Lactate and oxdizing NADH back to NAD+, so NAD can be used again for more glycolysis. </div>

    <h4>Lactic Acid to Human</h4>
    <div>In strenuous exercise, Aerobic Respiration can't keep up with the regeneration of NAD+, so lactic acid is produced to ensure glycolysis can continue. </div>
    <div>The produced Lactic Acid can either</div>
    <ul>Reoxidized to Pyruvate when Oxygen is available</ul>
    <ul>Transported to the Liver and convert to glucose and glycogen</ul>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3>Ethanol Fermentation</h3>
    <div>Yeast and some bacteria can function in both Aerobic and Anaerobic Conditions</div>
    <div>When function Anaerobically, they convert Pyruvate to Ethanol and CO2 through Ethanol Fermentation, at the same time convert NADH to NAD+ to use in glycolysis. </div>
