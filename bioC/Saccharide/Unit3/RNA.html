    <h1>RNA</h1>
    <div>RNA is made up by Sugar, Phosphate Group and Nitrogenous Base</div>
    
    <h3>Components:</h3>
    <li>Sugar
        <ul>5-carbon Ribose sugar, carbon labelled from 1' to 5' clockwise</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Phosphate Group (PO4)
        <ul>Attached on 5' carbon of the Ribose sugar with easter bond</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Nitrogenous Base
        <ul>Attached on 1' carbon of the Ribose sugar with glycosidic bond. </ul>
    </li>

    <h3>Sugar</h3>
    <div>Ribose is a monosaccharide that has 5 carbons. </div>
    <h4>Function in Metabolism</h4>
    <div>Ribose has it's involvement in intracellular energy transfers.</div>
    <div>NAD, FAD, NADP all contains the D-ribofuranose moiety, which is derived from D-Ribose, and NAD, FAD and NADP are electron acceptors in redox reactions in metabolic passways. </div>

    <h3>Nitrogeneous bases</h3>
    <li>Pyramidines
        <ul>Cytosine</ul>
        <ul>Uracil</ul>
        <ol> - Has Single Ring</ol>
    </li>
    <li>Purine
        <ul>Adenine</ul>
        <ul>Guaning</ul>
        <ol> - Has Double Ring</ol>
    </li>
    <p>RNA has Uracil instead of Thymine because Cytosine can spontaneously deaminate to form Uracilbases, which may result in undetectable mutation in DNA.So a methyl group is added to DNA to allow DNA repair mechanism identify illegimate U.</p>
    <p>RNA doesn't need it because of it's short life. </p>
