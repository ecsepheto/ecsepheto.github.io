    <h1>Metabolism</h1>
    <div>The sum of chemical reactions that occurs within each living organism's cell. It provides energy for organisms to live, grow and reproduce. </div>
    <h3>Metabolic Pathway</h3>
    <div>Series of Chemical Reactions in a cell, each reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme protein.</div>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3>Catabolism</h3>
    <div>Break down polymers (large molecules) into monomers (the smaller subunits) to produce Energy</div>
    <ul>Ex: Hydrolysis <br>Glycogen breaks down into glucoses</ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Anabolism</h3>
    <div>Build polymers from monomers by using Energy.</div>
    <ul>Ex: Condensation <br>Photosynthesis: CO2+H2O+Energy->Glucose+O2</ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Glucose:</h3>
    <div>Glucose has a significant role in Metabolism. In Animal, glucose undergoes glycolysis and provide ATP. In Plants, they synthesizes Glucose to build cellulose.</div>
