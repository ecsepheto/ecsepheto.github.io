	<div class="biaotir">BurOak Japanese Club</div>
	<div class="zehgwern">Welcome to this Club!<br><br>
	Actually, there are two reasons for me to create this club. <br>
	First, my friend started a puzzle club, and his resume is almost a publishable book, so I started feel peer pressure and start this clubs race. <br><br>
	Secondly, when writing your resume, you can say: "I'm a eager-learning person. I have a strong ability on learning languages. In highschool I managed my French class well and also joined a JAPANESE club!"<br>
	If you are applying a part time job like McDonald, you can even say: "I have a strong language skill because I joined a Japanese club in my school so I can handle Japanese customers." <br><br>
	Although I said that... this is still a pretty normal Japanese club, I won't just let us sit there and do nothing. I still has something I wanna show you guys tho that are related to Japanese. so Don't think it's just a wasting of time, it'll be pretty fun... I guess?<br><br>
	And all in all, these are all about my introduction to our club. Hope you will have a great experience in this club and... have fun~</div>
	
	<hr style="margin: 30px; margin-left: 3.5vw; ">
	
	<div class="biaotir">Things we might lalk about in our club</div>
	<ul>
		<li class="fuhbiaotir">Some anime scenes</li>
		<div class="zehgwern">Like some scenes in JoJo or other animes <br><br>
		This idea was inspired from<a href="https://www.jianshu.com/p/2f8bcd80887f">this website</a>， Although it's chinese tho... and it's analysing lyrics, and we are analysing lines. </div>
		<br>
		<li class="fuhbiaotir">Some wired things</li>
		<div class="zehgwern">Like the general rules about how Japanese transliterate English words into Katakana and how we can use it to Encrypte our English</div>
		<br>
		<li class="fuhbiaotir">Some strang knowledges</li>
		<div class="zehgwern">For example, the Zokuji and KeBaji in Japan<br><br>
		They are 2 forms of Kanji(Chinese characters) in Japan, that are not the correct way of using kanji but the way people often use it... kinda hard to explain in a short paragraph tho www, it's just like color vs colour, or people vs ppl. I'm planning to talk about this in the first day. </div>
