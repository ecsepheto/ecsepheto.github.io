width: 100%; - 100% of its container

width: 100vw; - 100% of the viewport width

100vh = 100% of the viewport height


1vmin = 1% of the viewport smallest side 

1vmax = 1% of the viewport largest side

vmin and vmax are useful for allowing content to change when you rotate the screen in which the vw and vh won't change but the vmin and vmax will.
